# Design Patterns in JS

1. Module Pattern: Encapsulates functionality to avoid polluting the global scope.

2. Revealing Module Pattern: Exposes selected functions or variables, keeping others private.

3. Factory Pattern: Creates objects based on different conditions without revealing creation logic.

4. Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of a class throughout the application.
